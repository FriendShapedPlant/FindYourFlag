<p>The number and kinds of gender identities are numerous, and nearly everyone's view of their gender(s) is/are unique. This is by no means an exhaustive list but covers many of the more common identities.</p>

<h2 id="gq">Genderqueer</h2>
<img src="flags\gender\genderqueer.jpg" alt="The genderqueer flag" class="left">
<p>Genderqueer is an umbrella term that encompasses gender identities that are either not of the binary, a combination of the binary genders, or are otherwise queer. Much like nonbinary, it is also often used as a gender identity.</p>
<p>The flag was designed by Marilyn Roxie in 2011. The lavender stripe represents androgyny and queer identities, the white people without genders, and the chartreuse people outside of the binary. Lavender was used as it is a blend of blue and pink (red), stereotypically gendered colors, and chartreuse was used as it is an inverse of lavender, thus making it the opposite.</p>

<h2 id="nb">Nonbinary</h2>
<img src="flags\gender\nonbinary.jpg" alt="The nonbinary flag" class="right">
<p>Nonbinary is an umbrella term that encompasses any gender identity that is neither completely male or female, or of the binary. Nonbinary is often used as a gender identity of its own as well.</p>
<p>The flag was created by Kye Rowan in 2014, and made  for those who didn't feel represented by the genderqueer flag. The yellow represents those who exist outside the binary, white those who have multiple genders, purple those who exist within the binary, and black those with no gender. Purple was used as it is a blend of blue and pink (red), stereotypically gendered colors, and yellow as it is complimentary to purple, making it as opposite to the gendered colors as possible.</p>

<p>Demigender is a gender identity that is partially but not entirely connected to a gender. Demiboy and demigirl are genders that are partially male/masculine and female/feminine respectively, and deminonbinary, or demienby, is a gender that is partially nonbinary. Alternate terms for demiboy/demigirl are demiguy/demigal, demiman/demiwoman, demimasculine/demifeminine, and demimasc/demifem.</p>
<p>The demiboy and demigirl flags were designed by Salem X, TransRants on Tumblr, in 2014. The deminonbinary flag was designed by DruxyDeity on Tumblr that same year, added on as a reblog to Salem's post proposing the previously mentioned flags. Meanings of the stripes are not included in their posts, but it is often believed the grey stripes represent the partiality of ones gender, the white nonbinary genders or being agender, and the colors pink, blue, or yellow respectively represent being female, male, or nonbinary.</p>

<h2 id="a">Agender</h2>
<img src="flags\gender\agender.jpg" alt="The agender flag" class="right">
<p>Agender describes a lack of gender, or someone who has no gender, though some also describe it as a neutral gender. There are other terms that also have a similar meaning to this, such as genderblank, genderless, gendervoid, and nullgender, and some of these terms may also have their own flags.</p>
<p>The flag was created by Salem X, TransRants on Tumblr, in 2014. The black represents the absence of gender, grey partial gender, and green gender that is neither male or female. Salem specifically wanted to represent this spectrum of feeling gender strongly and not at all, and not being on the male and female spectrum of gender.</p>

<h2 id="gf">Genderfluid</h2>
<img src="flags\gender\genderfluid.jpg" alt="The genderfluid flag" class="left">
<p>Genderfluid is a gender identity that changes. The frequency with which it changes, the reason(s) it changes, and the genders it changes to vary from person to person.</p>
<p>The flag was designed by JJ Poole (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220201193534/https://lostinthoughtspaceandfantasies.tumblr.com/post/28596790877/jaidynmarri-a-proposed-design-for-a-genderfluid" class="normal"> LostInThoughtSpaceAndFantasies</a> on Tumblr, previous username ThoughtsToBeRemembered) in 2012. The pink represents femininity, the white for all genders, purple for both masculinity and femininity, black lack of gender, and blue for masculinity.</p>

<h2 id="bi">Bigender</h2>
<img src="flags\gender\bigender2.jpg" alt="The pink, yellow, white, purple, and blue bigender pride flag" class="right">
<img src="flags\gender\bigender.jpg" alt="The blue, white, purple, white, and pink bigender pride flag" class="right clear">
<p>Bigender is a gender identity that consists of two or more genders, either existing simultaneously or is fluid between them. While it is commonly assumed that bigender means being both male and female, this is not always the case, and a bigender person can be of any genders.</p>
<p>According to extensive research, the bigender flag with yellow was made by Tumblr user FirePrincette in 2014, submitted to the blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214357/http://pride-flags-for-us.tumblr.com/post/88700586284/bigender-flag-proposal-as-the-current-one-is" class="normal">pride-flags-for-us</a>.The pink represents those who are female/feminine, the yellow those who are outside the binary, white those who are agender, purple those who are both male and female, and blue those who are male/masculine.</p>
<p>The creator of the second bigender flag is Tumblr user <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210531181409/https://camp-mlm.tumblr.com/post/186860266277/alternative-bigender-flag-design-okay-friends-so" class="normal">camp-mlm</a>, created in 2019. Though he leaves the meaning of the stripes up to interpretation, he shares his reasons for including them: The pinks and blues represent a bigender persons presentation (feminine, masculine, androgynous, etc), the top most white positive relationships, purple the unique experience of being bigender, as well as understanding one another within the community, and the bottom most white is for pride, self respect, and being true to yourself.</p>
<p>Note: There is a third, very commonly used bigender flag, but due to controversy of transphobia and predatory behavior surrounding the creator, and for conciseness of this page, it will not be provided here. There is also a flag circulated that is often called a bigender flag, but it is actually an old intersex flag.</p>

<h2 id="xeno">Xenogender</h2>
<img src="flags\gender\xeno.jpg" alt="The a-spec flag" class="left">
<p>Xenogender is an umbrella term to refer to a gender that cannot be understood within the human concepts of gender. Xenogenders are often themed around plants, animals, objects, ideas, and aesthetics. Their gender is not necessarily said thing, but can be likened to it, as it evokes a similar feeling or a sense of comfort for the person. This term is typically only found in online communities, but is nontheless a popular one.</p>
<p>The xenogender flag was designed by Roswell, PastelMemer on DeviantART (PastelRoswell on Tumblr), and uploaded to Pride-Flags on DeviantART in 2017. The colors of the flag call back to the central symbol, the astronomical sign for the asteroid Iris, being colors iris flowers are found in. Iris is the name of of a greek goddess who is associated with rainbows, thus the rainbow order of the colors. The central stripe is yellow, as it is a color often used to represent genders outside of the gender binary.</p>
